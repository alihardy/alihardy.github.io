  Hi! My name is Ali Hardy. I am a business student at the University of Maine with a concentration in marketing. I grew up in Lincoln, Maine. When people ask me where that is I tell them that it's about 45 minutes north of Orono, or 30 minutes north if I push it ;). Growing up in a small town was interesting to say the least. Everyone knew everyone, and the people you start kindergarden with are the ones you'll most likely graduate with. Going to Umaine was different because it's a bigger pool of people.
</p>
  <p>
    College life has been okay so far. It's been a challenge to try and figure out what I want to do with my life. I thought that I wanted to work in a lab, but I decided that that career path wasn't for me. It definately made me appreciate the peope that do decide to pursue a career in that field. This is my first year as a business major, and so far it's not to bad. I've definately learned a lot of things. My end goal is to get a degree in marketing and work in a marketing firm. I would like to live in a big city when a grow up, much like the city that I used in the background of my homepage. But we'll see where life takes me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of my interst include:
    <p>Dogs</p>
    <p>Cats</p>
    <p>Taylor Swift</p>
    <p>Amatuer Photography</p>
    <p>Books</p>
    <p>Travelling</p>
  </p>
  <p>
    I would really like to travel more in my life. My family and I have traveled to many different places together, but there is just so much more of the world that I want to see. Adventure awaits!
