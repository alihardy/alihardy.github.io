      My family immediate family consist of my mother, my father, my sister and me. My father is in the back left of the photo, then my mother, me, and my sister is taking up the foreground. My family is fairly small, but I think that's what makes us so close knit. We've always done things together as a family. Like go on family vacations or go out to eat as a family.

    My parents are both good people. I don't know what I would do with out them in my life. My mother is a very kind-hearted women who has this undescrible bubbly energy about her. She can make anyone become happy. She is truly a wonderful women. My Mother likes to go shopping with my Sister and I whenever she gets the change. She would consider herself more of a dog person. She absolutly adores our family dog. My mother is a every driven individual who is not afraid to speak her mind or stand up for herself and her beliefs. We may not always agree on things, but I admire and respect that she has her own opinions.

    My Father is a good man too. I think if I had to choose, my Father and I are more alike than me and my Mother. I believe we both posses a dry sense of humor. My Father and I are more of the silent type. We are both happy just sitting in silence. I would describe my Father as a very hard working man. He's very handy, because he build the family camp from the ground up. He made all the walls and all the structures within the camp. My Father is the type of man that will come whenever I need him. It doesn't matter the time or what it is, he will always be there for me. I am proud to call him my Father.

    My Sister is my best friend. We grew up together and I feel like she's the one that I can be real with. I could tell her anything and everything. I think the reason that we're so close is because we're so close in age. We are little less than 3 years apart. My Sister and I like to shop together, and get take out together. Honestly, we probably get to much take out together... People always ask us how we live together and work together, but my Sister and I don't really fight. We've never really fought, even when we were growing up. We bicker like siblings do, but we've never had a full-blown fight. I'm lucky to have such a great person in my life
