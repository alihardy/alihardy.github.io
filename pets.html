      The dog on the left is my pet dog Kyly. She is a pure breed Newfoundland. I got her when I was in 6th grade, which makes her around 8 years old now. She's a very lovable, somewhat goofy dog. I love her with all my heart. I wish she could live with me at my apartment, but i think my Mother would miss her too much. The dog on the left is one of my friend's dogs. I would like a dog like that when I grow up. It's a type of German Shepherd dog. I just think that they look so cute. But I don't think that I am financially stable enough to get such a hyper active dog at this point in my life.

      This is my cat Louis. I adopted him from the <a href="https://www.bangorhumane.org/">Bangor Humane Society</a>. I decided that I wanted a cat during the summer of last year. I had just moved into my first apartment and I thought that it was missing something. I grew up with pets in the household, so I thought that it would be a good idea to adopt a cat. I knew that I didn't want a kitten because I just don't have the time to train a kitten. When I got Louis he was only 3 years old. Getting him was the best decision that I've ever made. If you asked me 2 years ago whether I was a dog or cat person, I would have picked dog without hesitation. But now it's definately a toss up...
